FEEDBACK ANALYZED: None (feature chosen based on obvious improvement)

"As someone using this task app, I want my tasks to be saved in the browser so I don't lose them."

KEY PROMPT USED FOR COPILOT:
// TODO: Store tasks in localStorage when they are added or deleted.
// TODO: Load tasks from localStorage when the page loads.
// Each task should include its text and whether it's marked as done.
